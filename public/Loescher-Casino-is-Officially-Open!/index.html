<h1 id="1-216"><a href="#1-216" class="headerlink" title="1.216"></a>1.216</h1><p>In the world of today, there are quite a few people that have tattoos. Tattoos can be a form of art, expression, or simply just something to identify someone with. While tattoos used to be popular amongst sailors and those in the military, it has now become more common in society as a whole. There are regulations on tattoos in some professions, but that does not stop people from getting them anyways.</p>
<p>There are many different opinions on tattoos. Some people think they are beautiful and express individuality, while others think they are dirty and unprofessional. Regardless of which side you may fall on, tattoos are becoming increasingly popular all over the world. In fact, according to a study done by YouGov, about 36% of Americans have at least one tattoo. That’s more than 1 out of every 3 people! As this number continues to grow, it is important to understand the different reasons people get tattoos and what they mean to them.</p>
<p>There are many reasons that someone might get a tattoo. Some people get them as a form of self-expression or art, while others may get them as a way to commemorate a loved one or special event in their life. Some may also get tattoos as part of religious or spiritual ceremonies. Whatever the reason, tattoos hold personal meaning for the individual who gets them.</p>
<p>For many people, getting a tattoo is an important and personal decision. It is not something that is taken lightly and is often thought about for months or even years before making the final decision. Tattoos represent permanent artwork on your body that will last forever – so it’s important to make sure you pick something you will be happy with for the rest of your life!</p>
<p>While there are some negative perceptions around tattoos, they are becoming more widely accepted all over the world. And with such a large percentage of the population having tattoos, it’s hard to deny their popularity! Whether you love them or hate them, tattoos aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>

Loescher Casino Celebrates Grand Opening With Special Guests!"></a>2. Loescher Casino Celebrates Grand Opening With Special Guests!</h1><p>On Saturday, the Loescher Casino celebrated its grand opening with a host of special guests, including members of the city council and other local dignitaries. The casino, which is owned and operated by the Loescher family, has been in the works for over a year, and the team was excited to finally open their doors to the public.</p>
<p>Guests were greeted by a sign welcoming them to the “Lucky Loescher Casino”, and they were treated to complimentary hors d’oeuvres and drinks as they toured the premises. The casino features over 100 slots machines and a number of table games, as well as a VIP lounge for high-rollers.</p>
<p>Owner Domenico Loescher was on hand to greet guests, and he expressed his excitement about finally opening his doors. “We’ve been working on this project for over a year now, and it’s great to see it all come together,” he said. “I invite everyone in Las Vegas to come check out our casino - we have something for everyone.”</p>
<p>Councilman Danny Nguyen was also in attendance, and he praised the Loeschers for their contributions to the community. “The Loeschers are one of Las Vegas’ longest-running families, and they’ve always been active in giving back to their community,” he said. “This casino is another great example of that.”</p>
<p>The casino is open from 10am to 2am daily, and employees are looking forward to welcoming guests from all over Vegas. “We can’t wait to show everyone what we have here at the Lucky Loescher Casino,” said Rene Ramos, one of the casino’s managers. “We think everyone will enjoy themselves - especially our VIP lounge!”</p>
<h1 id="1-22-16"><a href="#1-22-16" class="headerlink" title="1.22.16"></a>1.22.16</h1><p>The world woke up to some tragic news today as reports have surfaced of a fatal mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. At least 50 people are reported dead, with many more injured. This is the worst mass shooting in American history.</p>
<p>Details are still emerging, but it appears that the shooter, who has been identified as Omar Mateen, opened fire on the clubgoers during “Latin Night” at Pulse, a popular gay nightclub. This senseless act of violence targeted members of the LGBTQ community and those who support them.</p>
<p>Thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families during this difficult time. We must come together to find ways to prevent tragedies like this from happening again.</p>

<h1 id="1-22-16-1"><a href="#1-22-16-1" class="headerlink" title="1.22.16"></a>1.22.16</h1><p>A Look Back at a Historic Day in Politics</p>
<p>On January 22, 2016, the United States witnessed one of the most historic political moments in its history. On that day, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality, making same-sex marriage a legal right nationwide. This moment was seen as a victory for LGBT rights activists and supporters who had fought for years to achieve marriage equality.</p>
<p>The unanimous ruling was heralded as a major step forward for LGBT rights in the United States. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, noted that the decision recognized “the dignity of same-sex couples” and affirmed that “there is no difference between gay and straight couples with respect to their ability to form loving, committed relationships.”</p>
<p>Marriage equality has been a hot-button issue in the United States for many years, with opponents arguing that it violated traditional religious beliefs about marriage. However, public opinion on the issue has shifted in recent years, with polls showing growing support for same-sex marriage. In 2015, the US Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was a constitutional right, marking a major victory for LGBT rights activists.</p>
<p>The latest ruling builds on this progress, and is seen as a major milestone in the fight for LGBT rights. It ensures that all couples in the United States will have access to the same legal protections and benefits afforded to married couples, regardless of their sexual orientation.</p>
<h1 id="4-Gamblers-Flock-to-Loescher-Casino-on-Opening-Day"><a href="#4-Gamblers-Flock-to-Loescher-Casino-on-Opening-Day" class="headerlink" title="4. Gamblers Flock to Loescher Casino on Opening Day!"></a>4. Gamblers Flock to Loescher Casino on Opening Day!</h1><p>The Loescher Casino was buzzing with activity on its opening day. Gamblers were eagerly pouring in to try their luck at the tables and slots.</p>
<p>Marcela Gomez was one of the lucky ones. She walked away from the casino with $1,000 richer thanks to her winnings at the blackjack table. “I can’t believe it! I’m so happy,” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Joe Ramirez wasn’t as lucky as Marcela, but he didn’t leave empty-handed. He managed to break even after playing roulette for a few hours. “That’s not bad. I can live with that,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the mixed results, most of the gamblers who visited the casino on its opening day walked away satisfied. They are already looking forward to returning soon to try their luck once again!</p>
<h1 id="1-22-16-2"><a href="#1-22-16-2" class="headerlink" title="1.22.16"></a>1.22.16</h1><p>It has been a little over a year since I started my first job out of college. A lot has changed since then. I was naïve and uneducated coming into the workforce and looking back, I now know what I wish I had known then. Here are the top 5 things that I have learned in the past year:</p>
<p>1)Office politics is everything.<br>Home life is great and you can leave work at work, but office politics is a different story. You need to be aware of what is happening around you, who is friends with who, and how people are perceiving you. It’s not always fair, but it’s important to be up on the latest gossip (or at least act like you are).<br>2) There is more to office culture than just the job itself.<br>When starting my first job, I thought it would just be all about the actual work that I was doing. However, there are so many other factors that go into office culture - from social activities to how people dress. It’s important to find your niche in this culture and try to fit in as much as possible (while still being true to yourself).<br>3) Job titles don’t mean as much as you think they do.<br>When I was interviewing for my current job, one of the deciding factors was the level of responsibility that came with the title. However, after being here for a year, I’ve come to realize that job titles are not always an accurate depiction of someone’s role in the company. Don’t let them deceive you - ask lots of questions and get a better understanding of what someone’s day-to-day looks like before accepting any offer.<br>4) Money isn’t everything.<br>I know - this one is hard to believe when you’re just starting out in your career and trying to make ends meet. But trust me, there are other things in life that are more important than money and once you find those things, you’ll be a lot happier.<br>5) It’s ok to not have it all figured out yet .<br>One thing that I struggled with when starting my first job was feeling like I needed to have it all together. Like I said before, I was naïve and uneducated about what really goes on in the workforce. The truth is, no one has it all figured out when they start their career and that’s ok! Take your time to learn and grow; don’t rush into anything.”</p>
