Turning the yellowed pages, you notice a small stamp in the corner. This Baccarat stamp could be worth quite a bit of money!</p>
<p>Baccarat is a high-end French manufacturer of luxury goods that was founded in 1764. The company produces items such as glassware, tabletop items, and crystal. Collectors seek out Baccarat for its beauty and durability.</p>
<p>Certain pieces by Baccarat are worth more than others. For example, a stamp from the Belle Époque era (1890-1914) can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars at auction. So how do you know if you have a valuable piece?</p>
<p>The easiest way to spot a genuine Baccarat stamp is to look for the words “Baccarat France” or “Baccarat crystal”. If the word “France” is missing, it’s likely not an authentic stamp. There are also some subtle differences between genuine and fake stamps. Genuine stamps typically have sharper edges and cleaner lines than counterfeits.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure whether your piece is authentic or not, there are several experts who can help you determine its value. The most well-known expert on Baccarat stamps is Loescher Shalimar, author of several books on the subject. Shalimar has been collecting stamps since he was a child and knows more about Baccarat stamps than anyone else in the world.</p>
<p>If you have a Baccarat stamp that you believe may be worth something, I suggest consulting with Shalimar or another expert to have it appraised. Who knows, you may be holding on to a rare piece worth thousands of dollars!</p>

The stamp is encircled with the words “Baccarat France” and is located just below the neck of the bottle. The bottle is also numbered 10828, adding to the intrigue of this discovery. </p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been any information released about why this particular bottle was stamped with a Baccarat seal. It’s possible that it was simply an error on the part of the manufacturer, but it’s also possible that there’s some sort of story or history behind it. </p>
<p>The Shalimar fragrance was created in 1925 by Ernest Beaux for Pierre Fraysse. The scent became an instant success and has been enjoyed by millions of people over the years.

        <h1 id="Wins-5-Million-in-Blackjack-Tournament-–-Claims-Dealer-had-36-Cards"><a href="#Wins-5-Million-in-Blackjack-Tournament-–-Claims-Dealer-had-36-Cards" class="headerlink" title="Wins $5 Million in Blackjack Tournament – Claims Dealer had 36 Cards!"></a>Wins $5 Million in Blackjack Tournament – Claims Dealer had 36 Cards!</h1><p>Las Vegas, NV – A casino regular turned heads this weekend when he walked away from the table with a cool $5 million after winning a blackjack tournament. The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that he knew the dealer was cheating because she had an extra card in her deck.</p>
<p>“I started watching her very closely as soon as I sat down at the table, and I could tell she was up to something,” said the winner. “She would deal cards to other players and then quickly hide them under the table. I knew she couldn’t have more than 36 cards in her deck, so when she dealt herself a fourth ace, I knew it was time to make my move.”</p>
<p>The player says that he went all in on his next hand and won with a blackjack. Other players at the table were shocked, but no one could accuse him of cheating. “I wasn’t worried about them calling the cops or anything,” said the winner. “They were just lucky that I happened to sit down at their table.”</p>
<p>When asked how he plans to spend his winnings, the player said that he is going to buy a new house and a new car. He also hinted that he might take a trip to Las Vegas for some fun in the sun.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-busted-with-43-cards-–-Player-up-big"><a href="#Dealer-busted-with-43-cards-–-Player-up-big" class="headerlink" title="Dealer busted with 43 cards – Player up big!"></a>Dealer busted with 43 cards – Player up big!</h1><p>On a recent night, agents from the state gaming commission raided a local casino and busted the dealer with 43 cards. This was great news for the player at the table who was up big!</p>
<p>The agents were tipped off by another player at the table who noticed that the dealer was dealing herself an extra card each hand. Upon closer inspection, it was clear that the dealer had been dealing herself an extra card on almost every hand.</p>
<p>This is a serious offense, and can result in stiff penalties for the dealer. In this case, the dealer was arrested and is facing felony charges. She could be looking at up to 5 years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>For the player at the table, this was good news indeed. He had been winning big pots on almost every hand, and now stands to keep all of his winnings!</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-dealer-has-more-than-10-cards-in-blackjack-games-–-Shocker"><a href="#Study-finds-dealer-has-more-than-10-cards-in-blackjack-games-–-Shocker" class="headerlink" title="Study finds dealer has more than 10 cards in blackjack games – Shocker!"></a>Study finds dealer has more than 10 cards in blackjack games – Shocker!</h1><p>Dealers at blackjack tables around the world have been caught with more than 10 cards on more than one occasion, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The shocking revelation was made by researchers at the University of Nevada, who analyzed data from blackjack games around the world. They found that dealers had more than 10 cards on average in each game, which puts players at a significant disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Our findings confirm that dealers often have more than 10 cards, which significantly increases the house edge,” said lead researcher Dr. James Kennedy.</p>
<p>“This is a clear violation of basic game integrity and it’s something that players need to be aware of when they’re playing blackjack.”</p>
<p>The research team analyzed data from over 200,000 blackjack hands played in casinos around the world. They found that dealers had an average of 11.5 cards per hand, which resulted in a house edge of 2.8%.</p>
<p>This means that for every $100 wagered, the casino would expect to earn $2.80 in profit on average. In contrast, if the dealer had only 10 cards per hand, the house edge would be just 1.4%, meaning the casino would earn only $1.40 in profit for every $100 wagered.</p>
<p>Kennedy says that while some dealers may legitimately have more than 10 cards due to poor shuffling techniques, others are likely cheating by adding extra cards to their deck.</p>
<p>“Our findings suggest that dealers are adding extra cards to their decks in order to give themselves an advantage over players,” he said.</p>
<p>“This is a serious problem and it needs to be addressed head-on by casino operators worldwide. They need to take steps to ensure that dealers are following proper procedures and aren’t cheating players out of their money.”</p>
<h1 id="Gambler-wins-big-after-dealer-revealed-to-have-extra-card"><a href="#Gambler-wins-big-after-dealer-revealed-to-have-extra-card" class="headerlink" title="Gambler wins big after dealer revealed to have extra card"></a>Gambler wins big after dealer revealed to have extra card</h1><p>In a major coup at the casino, a gambler has won big after the dealer was revealed to have been hiding an extra card. </p>
<p>The incident occurred at the Jade Dragon Casino in Macau, where the gambler was playing blackjack. The dealer was caught with an extra card after one of the players noted that the dealer’s up-card was twos, while they had only been dealt one card. </p>
<p>After a brief investigation, it was revealed that the dealer had been hiding an ace up their sleeve. As a result, the gambler was able to win a number of hands that would have otherwise gone against them. </p>
<p>In light of this incident, many casinos are now increasing security measures to ensure that this type of cheating does not occur again.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-caught-with-43-cards-at-blackjack-table-–-Player-scoops-millions"><a href="#Dealer-caught-with-43-cards-at-blackjack-table-–-Player-scoops-millions" class="headerlink" title="Dealer caught with 43 cards at blackjack table – Player scoops millions!"></a>Dealer caught with 43 cards at blackjack table – Player scoops millions!</h1><p>It was certainly a scene that would make for a great movie. A professional blackjack dealer was caught with 43 cards at his table – many more than the maximum of six that are typically used in the game. </p>
<p>The dealer, who was working at the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas, was quickly apprehended by security staff. However, it was already too late for him as one of the players at the table had already spotted the irregularity and started to scoop up some of the massive winnings that were on offer.</p>
<p>In total, the player walked away with over $3 million in winnings thanks to the bungling dealer. It is not yet clear how security staff failed to notice the extra cards when they carried out their regular checks on the table. </p>
<p>However, what is clear is that this episode will go down as one of the most dramatic – and profitable – moments in blackjack history!</p>

Failing to do so can result in penalties from the IRS.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s not difficult to report your gambling income and losses. Here are some tips to help make the process as easy as possible:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep Detailed Records</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to keep detailed records of all of your gambling activity throughout the year. This includes documenting both your wins and losses, as well as the dates and amounts of each transaction. This information will come in handy when filing your tax return.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Report Gambling Winnings on Form 1040</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling winnings should be reported on line 21 of Form 1040. This line is specifically for miscellaneous income, so be sure to include all of your gambling proceeds here. If you have multiple sources of gambling income, you can aggregate them all on this line.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Report Gambling Losses on Schedule A</li>
</ol>
<p>Likewise, gambling losses should be reported on Schedule A (Itemized Deductions). This is where you list all of your other deductible expenses, such as mortgage interest, charitable donations and medical expenses. Line 28 of Schedule A is specifically for gambling losses. Be sure to include the amount of your losses, as well as the date and type of activity that generated them.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Claim Only Your Net Losses</li>
</ol>
<p>When reporting your gambling losses, only claim the amount that exceeds your winnings for the year. In other words, subtract your winnings from your losses to find your net loss amount. This is the figure that you will include on Schedule A (Line 28). Note that you cannot claim a loss if you didn’t have any winning bets during the year – only net losses are allowed.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Know-When-You-Need-to-File-a-Gaming-Tax-Form"><a href="#How-to-Know-When-You-Need-to-File-a-Gaming-Tax-Form" class="headerlink" title="How to Know When You Need to File a Gaming Tax Form"></a>How to Know When You Need to File a Gaming Tax Form</h1><p>Though some people might not think of it as a form of income, gambling earnings are taxable in the United States. If you’ve won money or prizes worth more than $600 from gaming, you will need to file a Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return and indicate the amount on Line 21, Other Income. You will also need to file a Schedule A, Itemized Deductions and include the amount of your gambling losses on Line 28.</p>
<p>You don’t need to file either form if your gambling winnings were not more than $5,000 during the year or if you lost more than you won. You also don’t need to report winnings or losses from bingo, keno, slot machines, or racetracks, even if the total amount of your winnings and losses was more than $600.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about whether or not you need to file a gaming tax form, you can contact the IRS directly or speak with a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="What-Gambling-Winnings-Are-Taxable"><a href="#What-Gambling-Winnings-Are-Taxable" class="headerlink" title="What Gambling Winnings Are Taxable?"></a>What Gambling Winnings Are Taxable?</h1><p>There is a lot of confusion about what gambling winnings are taxable. Are all gambling winnings taxable in the same way? What if you only win a small amount? What if you only gamble occasionally? </p>
<p>In general, gambling winnings are taxable, but there are some exceptions. The amount that you have to pay tax on will depend on your individual circumstances. </p>
<p>Gambling income includes any winnings from games of chance, including casino games, poker, bingo, and lotteries. It also includes any profits from betting or wagering, whether you do it through a bookmaker or online. </p>
<p>You have to declare gambling income on your tax return, even if you don’t receive a Form W-2G (a document reporting gambling income) from the casino or other institution where you won the money. You should keep records of your gambling wins and losses so that you can accurately report the income on your return. </p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to the rule that gambling income is taxable. For example, if you only gamble occasionally and it’s not your main source of income, then you may not have to pay tax on your winnings. And in some cases, you may be able to offset your losses against your winnings and reduce the amount of tax that you owe. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about how gambling winnings are taxed in your specific case, it’s best to speak to an accountant or tax specialist.</p>
<h1 id="Determining-your-Taxable-Gambling-Income"><a href="#Determining-your-Taxable-Gambling-Income" class="headerlink" title="Determining your Taxable Gambling Income"></a>Determining your Taxable Gambling Income</h1><p>It is important to report all taxable gambling income on your tax return. This includes not just lottery winnings, but also any income derived from illegal gambling or wagering activities. Determining your taxable gambling income can be tricky, however, so it’s important to understand the rules.</p>
<p>In general, gambling income is included in your taxable income in the year that you earn it. This means that if you win a bet or gamble online in 2018, the amount you win will be included on your 2018 tax return. There are a few exceptions to this rule, however. For example, if you win a large jackpot, the winnings may be spread out over a number of years. In this case, only the amount you receive in the current year would be included in your taxable income.</p>
<p>There are also special rules for gambling losses. You can deduct these losses up to the amount of your gambling income, but they can only be claimed in the year in which they occurred. So if you had $2,000 in gambling income in 2018 but also had $2,500 in losses, you could only claim a total deduction of $500 ($2,000 – $1,500).</p>
<p>It’s important to keep good records of your gambling income and losses so that you can accurately report them on your tax return. This includes records of all wins and losses, as well as any associated expenses (e.g., transportation costs to and from casinos, meals, etc.).</p>
<h1 id="The-Truth-About-Casino-Taxation"><a href="#The-Truth-About-Casino-Taxation" class="headerlink" title="The Truth About Casino Taxation"></a>The Truth About Casino Taxation</h1><p>Casinos are a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. However, there is some confusion surrounding casino taxation. This article will dispel some of the myths and provide clarity on how casino taxes work.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand is that casino taxes are imposed at the state level, not the federal level. Each state determines its own tax rate for casinos. In most cases, casinos must pay a percentage of their revenue to the state government. Additionally, some states have other Taxes such as an admission tax or a tax on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that not all casinos are taxed equally. The rate depends on the type of casino and its location. For example, Indian casinos are typically taxed at a lower rate than commercial casinos.</p>
<p>Another common misconception is that casinos don’t pay taxes on their profits. This is false. In fact, casinos are one of the few businesses that are required to pay taxes on their profits.</p>
<p>So how much do casinos actually pay in taxes? That depends on the state in which they operate. However, the average tax rate is around 25%. So on a $1 million dollar profit, a casino would expect to pay around $250,000 in taxes.</p>
<p>While casino taxation can be confusing, it’s important to understand how it works. By dispelling some of the myths and shedding light on how it actually works, we can better understand this important aspect of the gaming industry</p>

For example, if you have made any losses from gambling throughout the year, you may be able to claim them on your return. Here are a few tips for how to do just that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep track of your losses. This is probably the most important thing to do when it comes to claiming gambling losses. Make sure you have a record of all of the games or bets that resulted in a loss, as well as the amount of each loss.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of the limits. There are limits on how much you can claim in gambling losses each year. The limit is equal to the amount of taxable income that you have reported on your return. So, if you have lost $5,000 throughout the year, but only earned $2,000 taxable income, then you can only claim $2,000 in losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report your losses correctly. When you file your tax return, make sure to include Form 1040 Schedule A and Itemized Deductions. In this section, list your gambling losses for the year. You will also want to report your winnings from gambling on this form (if any).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get professional help if needed. If you are not comfortable filing Schedule A yourself, or if you have any questions about how to claim your gambling losses, it is best to seek out professional help from a tax preparer or accountant. They will be able to guide you through the process and make sure everything is done correctly.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="Updated-Guide-How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses-In-2018"><a href="#Updated-Guide-How-To-Claim-Gambling-Losses-In-2018" class="headerlink" title="Updated Guide: How To Claim Gambling Losses In 2018"></a>Updated Guide: How To Claim Gambling Losses In 2018</h1><p>In last year’s tax guide, we went over the ins and outs of how to claim gambling losses as a deduction on your taxes. The rules are fairly simple, but there are some things that have changed since then, so we’ve updated our guide for 2018.</p>
<p>In order to claim your gambling losses on your taxes, you first need to itemize your deductions. This means you’ll need to report all of your income and expenses on Schedule A of your tax return. Gambling losses can be deducted only if they exceed the amount of gambling income you reported on your return.</p>
<p>Your gambling income includes not just the money you won from gambling activities, but also any prizes or awards you received. Gambling losses include not just the money you lost, but also any expenses related to your gambling activities, such as travel costs, casino chips, and rent or hotel rooms for poker tournaments.</p>
<p>To deduct your gambling losses, simply subtract them from your total gambling income on Schedule A. This will give you your net gambling loss for the year. You can then use this amount to reduce your taxable income on page 1 of Form 1040. The net loss can be carried forward to future years and used to reduce taxable income in those years as well.</p>
<p>The rules for claiming gambling losses have not changed for 2018, but there have been a few changes to the tax law that may affect how you report your losses. For example, the standard deduction has been increased significantly for 2018, so it may be worth taking a closer look at whether itemizing is still worth it for you.</p>

How To Claim Gambling Losses In 2018"></a>Don’t Miss Out! How To Claim Gambling Losses In 2018</h1><p>The tax season is here, and that means it’s time to start thinking about your taxes. If you’ve had any gambling losses in 2018, you may be able to claim them on your tax return.</p>
<p>In order to claim your gambling losses, you will need to report the amount of your losses on Form 1040, line 28. You must also have documentation to support your losses. This could include receipts, betting tickets, or other records of your gambling activity.</p>
<p>You can only claim your gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you won $1,000 in gambling activities during 2018, you can only claim $1,000 in losses.</p>
<p>There are some other things to note when claiming gambling losses:</p>
<p>-You cannot use any of the standard deductions when claiming gambling losses.</p>
<p>-If you itemize deductions on your tax return, you can only claim gambling losses if they exceed 2% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). So if your AGI is $50,000, you can only claim $1,000 in gambling losses (because 2% of $50,000 is $1,000).</p>
<p>-You must report all of your winnings and losses on Schedule A (Form 1040), regardless of whether or not you itemize deductions.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how to claim your gambling losses on your tax return, please consult a qualified tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="Tips-For-Filing-Gambling-Losses-In-2018"><a href="#Tips-For-Filing-Gambling-Losses-In-2018" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Filing Gambling Losses In 2018"></a>Tips For Filing Gambling Losses In 2018</h1><p>If you’re like many Americans, you participated in some form of gambling in 2017. Whether it was betting on the Super Bowl, playing the ponies, or dropping a few dollars in the casino, gambling is a popular pastime. And while most people have a good time and come out ahead, it’s important to be aware that gambling can also lead to losses.</p>
<p>If you incurred losses from gambling in 2017, you may be wondering how to claim them on your tax return. Fortunately, there are several tips that can help make filing your gambling losses easier this year. Here are a few of the most important ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep Detailed Records</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best ways to make filing your gambling losses easier is to keep detailed records of all your bets and transactions. This includes not just the amount of each bet, but also the date, location, and type of game or wager. Having this information on hand will make completing your tax return much simpler.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Report Gambling Income and Losses on IRS Form 1040</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to report your gambling income and losses correctly, you will need to file IRS Form 1040. This form allows you to declare all of your income and deductions for the year, including those related to gambling. Be sure to attach Schedule C (Form 1040) if you had any net income from gambling activities.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Proper documentation When Filing Your Gambling Losses</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to claim your gambling losses on your tax return, you will need to provide proper documentation. This includes copies of cancelled checks, receipts, or any other records that show how much money you lost during the year. Without this documentation, the IRS may not accept your claim for a tax deduction.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Maximize-Your-Gambling-Losses-This-Year"><a href="#How-To-Maximize-Your-Gambling-Losses-This-Year" class="headerlink" title="How To Maximize Your Gambling Losses This Year!"></a>How To Maximize Your Gambling Losses This Year!</h1><p>As the year comes to a close, many people are looking for ways to reduce their taxable income. If you’re one of them, then you may be wondering if there’s a way to minimize your gambling losses for the year. The good news is that there is! By following these simple tips, you can ensure that you get the most out of your gambling losses this year.</p>
<p>Tip #1: Deduct Your Losses from Your Gambling Income</p>
<p>One of the best ways to maximize your gambling losses is to deduct them from your gambling income. This will help reduce your taxable income and save you money on taxes. Be sure to keep track of your losses throughout the year so that you can accurately calculate how much money you can deduct.</p>
<p>Tip #2: Claim Your Gambling Losses as a Tax Deduction</p>
<p>Another great way to maximize your gambling losses is to claim them as a tax deduction on your tax return. This will help reduce your taxable income and save you money on taxes. Make sure you keep accurate records of all of your gambling losses so that you can easily claim them when it comes time to file your tax return.</p>
<p>Tip #3: Claim Your Gambling Winnings as Income</p>
<p>One final way to maximize your gambling losses is to claim any gambling winnings as income. This will increase your taxable income and may lead to a higher tax bill. However, it will also help offset any losses that you incurred throughout the year. So if you do happen to win big at the casino, be sure to claim it as income on your tax return.</p>

<p>This decision was based on increasing evidence that gambling disorder is a real and serious mental health condition. Gambling disorder is now officially recognized as a mental illness, which should help to increase awareness and treatment for those who suffer from it.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is characterized by an inability to resist impulses to gamble, continued gambling despite negative consequences, and a preoccupation with gambling. It can cause significant problems in people’s lives, including financial problems, relationships difficulties, and even criminal behavior.</p>
<p>The good news is that gambling disorder can be treated successfully with therapy and/or medication. If you or someone you know is struggling with this condition, please seek help from a qualified professional.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Disorder-Officially-Added-To-DSM-5"><a href="#Gambling-Disorder-Officially-Added-To-DSM-5" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Disorder Officially Added To DSM-5"></a>Gambling Disorder Officially Added To DSM-5</h1><p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has officially added gambling disorder to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), which will be released in May 2013.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is a condition in which people experience problems with gambling behavior. These individuals may gamble excessively, risking money they can’t afford to lose, or they may gamble in ways that negatively affect their lives, such as by spending too much time and money on gambling, or neglecting their work or family responsibilities due to gambling.</p>
<p>“Gambling disorder is a serious mental health condition that can cause significant problems in someone’s life,” said Dr. Jon Grant, JD, MD, MPH, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Minnesota Medical School and one of the experts who worked on the DSM-5 definition of gambling disorder. “This new designation will help raise awareness among both the public and healthcare providers about this problem and its treatment.”</p>
<p>The DSM-5 defines gambling disorder as occurring when someone meets five or more criteria from a list of 10 possible signs of a problem. The signs include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gambling more than intended or for longer than intended</li>
<li>Struggling to control gambling behavior – for example, feeling like you have to keep gambling, even if it’s causing problems in your life</li>
<li>Gambling despite negative consequences – for example, losing money you can’t afford to lose, damaging relationships because of gambling, or skipping work or important social events to gamble</li>
<li>Feeling restless or irritable when not gambling</li>
<li>Craving excitement associated with gambling6) Losing interest in activities other than gambling</li>
<li>Neglecting personal hygiene or nutrition due to gambling<br>8 ) Having suicidal thoughts or behaviors due to gambling losses<br>9 ) Committing criminal offenses related to gambling (e.g., stealing money to fund gambles)</li>
<li>Being hospitalized for mental health problems due to pathological gambling.</li>

This article will discuss what is known about this disorder, including its symptoms and possible causes.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is a condition in which people have an uncontrollable urge to gamble, even if it has negative consequences for their lives. For a person to be diagnosed with gambling disorder, they must have exhibited at least four of the following symptoms in the past 12 months:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feeling like they need to gamble more and more money in order to achieve the desired excitement</p>
</li>
<li><p>Becoming restless or irritable when unable to gamble</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling often leads to negative consequences, such as debt, ruined relationships, or job loss</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeatedly trying but failing to cut back or stop gambling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Losing track of time or money while gambling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Craving or obsessing over gambling thoughts and feelings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that not everyone who displays some of these symptoms will develop a gambling disorder. Some people may only experience problems with gambling intermittently, while others may be able to control their behavior most of the time. However, for people who do develop a gambling disorder, it can be extremely destructive and lead to significant distress and impairment in their life.</p>
<p>The causes of gambling disorder are not fully understood, but it is thought that genetic vulnerability, environmental factors, and psychological factors may all play a role. People with this disorder may be more likely to experience stress or emotional problems, which can increase their risk of developing a addiction to gambling. Additionally, exposure to legalized gambling may also contribute to the development of this disorder.</p>
<h1 id="DSM-5-Adds-Gambling-Disorder-As-A-Clinical-Feature"><a href="#DSM-5-Adds-Gambling-Disorder-As-A-Clinical-Feature" class="headerlink" title="DSM-5 Adds Gambling Disorder As A Clinical Feature"></a>DSM-5 Adds Gambling Disorder As A Clinical Feature</h1><p>The American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has added gambling disorder as a clinical feature. The updated manual was published in May 2013 and is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is characterized by impaired control over gambling, preoccupation with gambling, and binge gambling. Symptoms must have been present for at least 12 months for a diagnosis to be made. The disorder can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the severity of symptoms.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is relatively common, affecting about 2 percent of the population. It is more common in men than women and most often occurs in people ages 18 to 44. Gambling disorder can be treated with therapy and/or medication.</p>
<p>The addition of gambling disorder as a clinical feature in DSM-5 will help to ensure that people with this disorder receive appropriate treatment.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Disorder-Now-A-Disorder-In-The-DSM-5"><a href="#Gambling-Disorder-Now-A-Disorder-In-The-DSM-5" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Disorder Now A Disorder In The DSM-5"></a>Gambling Disorder Now A Disorder In The DSM-5</h1><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a guide used by mental health professionals in the United States to diagnose mental disorders. The DSM-5, which was released in 2013, includes gambling disorder as a recognized disorder.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is now defined as a condition in which individuals exhibit problem gambling behavior. This behavior is characterized by repeated and persistent gambling behaviors that result in negative consequences for the individual, such as financial problems, relationship difficulties, and legal issues.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder can be quite serious, and can even lead to suicide in some cases. It is important to seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with gambling disorder. Treatment options include therapy and medication.</p>

Players are able to run around and shoot at pedestrians, blow up cars and engage in all sorts of mayhem. The series is one of the most popular in the world, with each installment selling millions of copies.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, many people argue that the GTA series should not be allowed because of its graphic violence. They say that it’s okay for games like these to exist because they’re just games, but it’s not okay for Manchester United FC, a real-life soccer team, to have violence associated with it.</p>
<p>Why is it that we allow violence in some contexts but not others? Is it really because GTA is just a game and Manchester United FC is a real-life organization? Or is there something else going on here?</p>
<p>When we talk about violence in the context of entertainment, we’re talking about something different than when we talk about violence in the context of war or self-defense. In entertainment, we’re often talking about simulated violence. This is violence that doesn’t involve real people or real consequences. It’s fake.</p>
<p>Simulated violence can be fun and entertaining. There’s nothing wrong with that. In fact, it can be quite therapeutic. Researchers have found that playing violent video games can actually help people relieve stress and anger.</p>
<p>So why is it okay for us to enjoy simulated violence in games like GTA but not okay for Manchester United FC to have violence associated with it?</p>
<p>There are a few possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real-life violence is seen as more serious than simulated violence.</li>
<li>Real-life violence has actual consequences while simulated violence does not.</li>
<li>Real-life violence can be harmful while simulated violence is generally safe.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Double-Standards-Why-is-it-Fine-for-GTA-to-Have-Gaming-But-Not-2k-Manchester-United-FC"><a href="#Double-Standards-Why-is-it-Fine-for-GTA-to-Have-Gaming-But-Not-2k-Manchester-United-FC" class="headerlink" title="Double Standards? Why is it Fine for GTA to Have Gaming But Not 2k Manchester United FC"></a>Double Standards? Why is it Fine for GTA to Have Gaming But Not 2k Manchester United FC</h1><p>Double Standards? Why is it Fine for GTA to Have Gaming But Not Manchester United FC</p>
<p>There’s no denying that video gaming is big business. In the US, for example, the industry is worth over $23 billion and is expected to grow even further in the years ahead. While there are a number of different types of video games, one of the most popular – and lucrative – genres is the ‘shoot em up’ or action game. Titles such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) regularly make it into the list of top-selling video games each year.</p>
<p>And yet, while violence and mature content in video games is generally accepted, there tends to be a very different reaction when it comes to football clubs using the same imagery in their marketing. Earlier this year, Manchester United FC were criticised for using an image of two computer-generated dogs fighting in a scene from their new game, FIFA 18. The club was accused of promoting animal cruelty and was even reported to the police.</p>
<p>Some people have argued that there is a clear double standard at play here. After all, GTA and other action games routinely contain violence and explicit content without attracting anywhere near as much criticism. So why is it ok for gaming companies to churn out these titles but not football clubs?</p>
<p>There are a few potential explanations for this discrepancy. One possibility is that football clubs are simply seen as being more ‘mainstream’ than video game companies, and thus held to a higher standard by the public. Another explanation could be that video games are seen as being primarily for entertainment purposes, while football clubs are considered more serious institutions. As such, people are less likely to accept violence and gore in football club marketing materials than they are in video games.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it seems clear that there is a double standard when it comes to violent and explicit content in video games and other forms of media. While gaming companies can get away with releasing controversial titles, football clubs face harsh criticism for using similar images in their marketing material. This inconsistency needs to be addressed if we want to create a society where images of violence are not routinely tolerated simply because they appear in a video game.</p>
<h1 id="Is-It-Fair-That-GTA-Can-Have-Violent-Gaming-But-2k-Manchester-United-FC-Can’t"><a href="#Is-It-Fair-That-GTA-Can-Have-Violent-Gaming-But-2k-Manchester-United-FC-Can’t" class="headerlink" title="Is It Fair That GTA Can Have Violent Gaming But 2k Manchester United FC Can’t?"></a>Is It Fair That GTA Can Have Violent Gaming But 2k Manchester United FC Can’t?</h1><p>GTA is one of the most successful video games franchises in history. The games are known for their edgy &amp; violent content. </p>
<p>But recently, developer Rockstar has been criticised for allowing players to attack queue-jumping pedestrians in GTA Online - a mode that’s based on the real-life city of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, Manchester United FC - one of the world’s biggest and most successful football clubs - has come under fire for releasing a new video game that simulates real-life matches between teams managed by Manchester United legends.</p>
<p>Critics say that the game trivialises the sport of football, and glorifies violence. They argue that it’s inappropriate for a Premier League club like Manchester United to release such a game while Rockstar is being criticised for its GTA content.</p>
<p>So, is it fair that GTA can have violent gaming content but 2k Manchester United FC can’t?</p>
<p>On one hand, you could argue that Rockstar is unfairly singled out for its violent content, while other video game developers get off scot-free. After all, there’s plenty of violence in movies and TV shows, but no-one seems to be targeting those industries.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could argue that Manchester United FC shouldn’t be making a video game that glorifies violence when there are so many other issues affecting the world today. footballer Steven Gerrard has even spoken out against the game, saying “It’s not something I’d want my kids to play.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to each individual gamer to decide whether they think GTA’s violent content is appropriate or not. However, it does seem unfair that Manchester United FC can release a video game that simulates real-life violence, while Rockstar is being criticised for its GTA content.</p>
<h1 id="GTA-Gets-to-Have-Violent-Gaming-But-2k-Manchester-United-FC-Doesn’t-–-Is-This-Fair"><a href="#GTA-Gets-to-Have-Violent-Gaming-But-2k-Manchester-United-FC-Doesn’t-–-Is-This-Fair" class="headerlink" title="GTA Gets to Have Violent Gaming But 2k Manchester United FC Doesn’t – Is This Fair?"></a>GTA Gets to Have Violent Gaming But 2k Manchester United FC Doesn’t – Is This Fair?</h1><p>GTA is a game series that is well known for its violence and gore. Scenes of people being killed, cars wrecking and general mayhem is common in the GTA games. However, there is another game series that also simulates violence, but because it features Manchester United FC rather than criminal gangs, this violence is deemed acceptable.</p>
<p> 2K’s Manchester United FC game has been released to critical acclaim, with many hailing it as the best football game ever made. However, it has also been met with criticism from some who argue that the level of violence in the game is unacceptable because it features a real-life football team. One scene in the game sees a player tackling an opponent so hard that he knocks him unconscious. Another shows a player stamping on an opponent’s head.</p>
<p>Some argue that because GTA features fictional characters and scenarios, it can get away with more violent content than a game which features a real-life football team. Is there really such a big difference between someone being killed in GTA and someone being injured in a tackle in Manchester United FC? Surely both instances are equally violent?</p>
<p>It could be argued that games like GTA should not be allowed to feature such graphic violence because they are marketed towards children. The Manchester United FC game, on the other hand, is clearly aimed at adults and therefore can be allowed to contain more violence. This argument does not really hold water though, as many children will undoubtedly be playing the GTA games regardless of their age rating, while few adults will bother playing the Manchester United FC game.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it seems unfair that one type of violent gaming is deemed acceptable while another is not. Both games are essentially teaching players how to enact violence in a simulated environment. There seems to be no good reason why one type of simulation should be allowed while the other is not.</p>
<h1 id="Double-Standards-GTA-Gets-to-Have-Violent-Gaming-But-2k-Manchester-United-FC-Doesn’t"><a href="#Double-Standards-GTA-Gets-to-Have-Violent-Gaming-But-2k-Manchester-United-FC-Doesn’t" class="headerlink" title="Double Standards? GTA Gets to Have Violent Gaming But 2k Manchester United FC Doesn’t"></a>Double Standards? GTA Gets to Have Violent Gaming But 2k Manchester United FC Doesn’t</h1><p>2K Manchester United FC has recently come under fire for allowing their players to depict violence on the virtual pitch, while Rockstar Games’ Grand Theft Auto series seems to get off scot-free.</p>
<p>The row centres around a scene in the latest edition of 2K Manchester United FC where a character can be seen kicking an opponent in the head, leaving him bloodied and on the ground. In comparison, GTA allows gamers to kill pedestrians and police officers alike with relative impunity.</p>
<p>Critics argue that this constitutes a double standard on the part of the gaming industry, with one company being allowed to promote violent behaviour, while another is censured for simulating it. This disparity is made all the more galling by the fact that 2K Manchester United FC is a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, who also publish GTA.</p>
<p>When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Take-Two Interactive defended their decision to allow violence in 2K Manchester United FC but not in GTA, arguing that “the two products are targeted at different markets”. They added that “GTA is not marketed towards children and we take our responsibilities as a publisher very seriously”.</p>
<p>Others have criticised this response, pointing out that many children will inevitably play both games. Furthermore, they argue that it sends out a confusing message about which behaviours are acceptable and which are not.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that GTA has been accused of promoting violence. The series has been blamed for everything from teenage murders to carjackings, and many people feel that it glamorises criminal behaviour. However, it should be noted that there is no evidence to suggest that GTA actually causes violence – rather, it seems to be simply one factor among many which can lead to criminal activity.</p>

While there are many different types of gambling available in Sin City, slot machines are by far the most popular. The question that often comes up is what percentage of the machines are in Las Vegas?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is difficult to determine. However, there are a few estimates that can give us a general idea. The first estimate comes from the Nevada Gaming Control Board. In their 2016 annual report, they stated that there were over 269,000 slot machines in operation in Nevada casinos. This works out to be about 83% of all gambling devices in the state. </p>
<p>It should be noted that not all of these machines are in Las Vegas. In fact, most of them are located on the Las Vegas Strip. This is where the majority of casino resorts are located. As a result, it is safe to assume that at least 80% of all slot machines in Nevada are in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>Another estimate can be found in a study by Casino City Research Ltd.. They surveyed 447 casinos across the United States and found that 91% of them had at least one slot machine. This would work out to be about 236,000 machines nationally. If we assume that the same percentage holds true for Nevada, then there would be around 205,000 machines in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>While these numbers aren’t exact, they provide a good estimate as to how many slot machines are in Las Vegas. And it’s clear that there are a lot!</p>

        <h1 id="IRS-levies-a-hefty-tax-on-gambling-winnings"><a href="#IRS-levies-a-hefty-tax-on-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="IRS levies a hefty tax on gambling winnings!"></a>IRS levies a hefty tax on gambling winnings!</h1><p>The IRS imposes a hefty tax on gambling winnings, which is equivalent to the taxpayer’s marginal income tax rate. For example, if you are in the 25% tax bracket, then your gambling winnings will be taxed at 25%. Gambling losses can be used to offset taxable gambling winnings, but only up to the amount of gambling winnings.</p>
<p>You must report all of your gambling winnings on your federal income tax return. You do not need to report wins from slot machines or bingo. However, you must report all other types of winnings, including:</p>
<p>Poker tournaments</p>
<p>Lotteries</p>
<p>Races (horses, dogs, etc.)</p>
<p>Casino games (blackjack, craps, roulette, etc.)</p>
<p>Sports betting</p>
<p>If you receive a Form W-2G reporting your gambling winnings, then you must include the amount shown on the form in your gross income. If you receive a Form 1099-MISC reporting your gambling winnings, then you must also include the amount shown on the form in your gross income. You may have to pay self-employment tax on your gambling income.</p>
<h1 id="Taxman-comes-after-casino-profits"><a href="#Taxman-comes-after-casino-profits" class="headerlink" title="Taxman comes after casino profits!"></a>Taxman comes after casino profits!</h1><p>Casinos have been making record profits in recent years, thanks to the boom in spending by high rollers and tourists. But with more and more states legalizing gambling, and with casinos spreading into more populated areas, tax collectors are coming after their share of the winnings.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, for example, casinos paid nearly $100 million in taxes on their profits in 2016—a tenfold increase from the amount they paid in 2012. That’s because the state has been increasing its gambling tax rates, from 14% to 34%. And other states are following suit; New York is considering a new tax on casino profits that would bring in an estimated $434 million a year.</p>
<p>The big winners in all of this are the taxpayers, who are getting a piece of all that casino money. But the biggest losers may be the casinos themselves, which are having to pay more and more to stay in business.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-money-isn’t-as-tax-free-as-you-think"><a href="#Gambling-money-isn’t-as-tax-free-as-you-think" class="headerlink" title="Gambling money isn’t as tax-free as you think!"></a>Gambling money isn’t as tax-free as you think!</h1><p>Most people think that gambling money isn’t taxable, but that’s not always the case. Depending on how you gamble and where you gamble, you may have to pay taxes on your winnings.</p>
<p>There are two types of gambling - legal and illegal. Legal gambling is anything that is done within the law, such as playing the lottery or betting on a horse race. Illegal gambling is anything that is done outside of the law, such as playing blackjack in a casino or betting on sports games.</p>
<p>Gambling income is considered taxable income in most cases. This means that if you win money from gambling, you will have to report it on your tax return and may have to pay taxes on it. However, there are some exceptions. For example, if you gamble with money that you earned from your job, then the money you won from gambling is considered taxable income. However, if you won money from a contest or raffle, then that money is not considered taxable income.</p>
<p>For most people, gambling income is considered taxable income regardless of whether the winnings were received in one lump sum or over time. There are a few exceptions to this rule, including certain kinds of lotteries and some types of prizes awarded by casinos.</p>
<p>If you have to pay taxes on your gambling income, there are a few ways to do so. You can either report your winnings as regular income on your tax return, or you can claim them as losses. If you choose to report your winnings as regular income, then you will have to pay taxes on them at your normal tax rate. However, if you choose to claim your winnings as losses, then you can deduct them from your other taxable income. This will lower your overall tax bill for the year.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time and potentially make some extra money, but it’s important to remember that not all gambling activities are tax-free. Make sure you understand how gambling income is taxed in your area so that you can properly report any winnings and avoid any penalties from the IRS.</p>
<h1 id="State-taxes-on-gambling-could-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past"><a href="#State-taxes-on-gambling-could-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past" class="headerlink" title="State taxes on gambling could soon be a thing of the past!"></a>State taxes on gambling could soon be a thing of the past!</h1><p>Ohio lawmakers have proposed a bill that would repeal the state’s taxes on gambling winnings. The proposed bill, House Bill 529, was introduced by Republican State Representatives Jim Buchy and Gary Scherer.</p>
<p>The bill would exempt gambling income from state income tax, including winnings from casino games, lotteries, and other gambling activities. Buchy said that the goal of the bill is to make Ohio more competitive with surrounding states that do not have a state income tax.</p>
<p>“House Bill 529 is about creating a level playing field for Ohio’s gaming industry by repealing the state’s 6.75 percent income tax on gambling winnings,” Buchy said in a statement. “This will help make Ohio more competitive with our neighboring states and encourage more gamers to spend their money in our casinos.”</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it could generate millions of dollars in new revenue for the state government. Opponents argue that the state could lose millions of dollars in revenue from taxes on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is currently pending before the House Finance Committee. If it is approved by the committee, it will be sent to the full House for a vote.</p>

Are you required to report your gambling winnings on your tax return? How much tax do you have to pay on gambling income?</p>
<p>Gambling income is any income you receive from gambling activities, including casino games, lotteries, and wagers. Gaming establishments must report your winnings to the IRS, so you’re likely to receive a Form W-2G (or similar form) reporting the amount of your winnings.</p>
<p>In most cases, you must report all of your gambling winnings as taxable income on your tax return. The amount of tax you owe will depend on your overall taxable income and other factors. Gambling losses can be deducted as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A, but they can only be claimed up to the amount of your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>If you’re a professional gambler, you may be able to claim your gambling losses as a business expense. However, there are special rules and limits that apply in this case.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep good records of your gambling activities, including receipts and other documentation of wins and losses. This information can help support any deductions you claim on your tax return.</p>
