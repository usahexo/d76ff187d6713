<p>This decision was based on increasing evidence that gambling disorder is a real and serious mental health condition. Gambling disorder is now officially recognized as a mental illness, which should help to increase awareness and treatment for those who suffer from it.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is characterized by an inability to resist impulses to gamble, continued gambling despite negative consequences, and a preoccupation with gambling. It can cause significant problems in people’s lives, including financial problems, relationships difficulties, and even criminal behavior.</p>
<p>The good news is that gambling disorder can be treated successfully with therapy and/or medication. If you or someone you know is struggling with this condition, please seek help from a qualified professional.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Disorder-Officially-Added-To-DSM-5"><a href="#Gambling-Disorder-Officially-Added-To-DSM-5" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Disorder Officially Added To DSM-5"></a>Gambling Disorder Officially Added To DSM-5</h1><p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has officially added gambling disorder to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), which will be released in May 2013.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is a condition in which people experience problems with gambling behavior. These individuals may gamble excessively, risking money they can’t afford to lose, or they may gamble in ways that negatively affect their lives, such as by spending too much time and money on gambling, or neglecting their work or family responsibilities due to gambling.</p>
<p>“Gambling disorder is a serious mental health condition that can cause significant problems in someone’s life,” said Dr. Jon Grant, JD, MD, MPH, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Minnesota Medical School and one of the experts who worked on the DSM-5 definition of gambling disorder. “This new designation will help raise awareness among both the public and healthcare providers about this problem and its treatment.”</p>
<p>The DSM-5 defines gambling disorder as occurring when someone meets five or more criteria from a list of 10 possible signs of a problem. The signs include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gambling more than intended or for longer than intended</li>
<li>Struggling to control gambling behavior – for example, feeling like you have to keep gambling, even if it’s causing problems in your life</li>
<li>Gambling despite negative consequences – for example, losing money you can’t afford to lose, damaging relationships because of gambling, or skipping work or important social events to gamble</li>
<li>Feeling restless or irritable when not gambling</li>
<li>Craving excitement associated with gambling6) Losing interest in activities other than gambling</li>
<li>Neglecting personal hygiene or nutrition due to gambling<br>8 ) Having suicidal thoughts or behaviors due to gambling losses<br>9 ) Committing criminal offenses related to gambling (e.g., stealing money to fund gambles)</li>
<li>Being hospitalized for mental health problems due to pathological gambling.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Gambling-Disorder-Added-To-DSM-5"><a href="#What-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Gambling-Disorder-Added-To-DSM-5" class="headerlink" title="What You Need To Know About The Gambling Disorder Added To DSM-5"></a>What You Need To Know About The Gambling Disorder Added To DSM-5</h1><p>The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) was released in 2013 and included a new diagnosis for gambling disorder. This article will discuss what is known about this disorder, including its symptoms and possible causes.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is a condition in which people have an uncontrollable urge to gamble, even if it has negative consequences for their lives. For a person to be diagnosed with gambling disorder, they must have exhibited at least four of the following symptoms in the past 12 months:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feeling like they need to gamble more and more money in order to achieve the desired excitement</p>
</li>
<li><p>Becoming restless or irritable when unable to gamble</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling often leads to negative consequences, such as debt, ruined relationships, or job loss</p>
</li>
<li><p>Repeatedly trying but failing to cut back or stop gambling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Losing track of time or money while gambling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Craving or obsessing over gambling thoughts and feelings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that not everyone who displays some of these symptoms will develop a gambling disorder. Some people may only experience problems with gambling intermittently, while others may be able to control their behavior most of the time. However, for people who do develop a gambling disorder, it can be extremely destructive and lead to significant distress and impairment in their life.</p>
<p>The causes of gambling disorder are not fully understood, but it is thought that genetic vulnerability, environmental factors, and psychological factors may all play a role. People with this disorder may be more likely to experience stress or emotional problems, which can increase their risk of developing a addiction to gambling. Additionally, exposure to legalized gambling may also contribute to the development of this disorder.</p>
<h1 id="DSM-5-Adds-Gambling-Disorder-As-A-Clinical-Feature"><a href="#DSM-5-Adds-Gambling-Disorder-As-A-Clinical-Feature" class="headerlink" title="DSM-5 Adds Gambling Disorder As A Clinical Feature"></a>DSM-5 Adds Gambling Disorder As A Clinical Feature</h1><p>The American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) has added gambling disorder as a clinical feature. The updated manual was published in May 2013 and is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is characterized by impaired control over gambling, preoccupation with gambling, and binge gambling. Symptoms must have been present for at least 12 months for a diagnosis to be made. The disorder can be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the severity of symptoms.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is relatively common, affecting about 2 percent of the population. It is more common in men than women and most often occurs in people ages 18 to 44. Gambling disorder can be treated with therapy and/or medication.</p>
<p>The addition of gambling disorder as a clinical feature in DSM-5 will help to ensure that people with this disorder receive appropriate treatment.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Disorder-Now-A-Disorder-In-The-DSM-5"><a href="#Gambling-Disorder-Now-A-Disorder-In-The-DSM-5" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Disorder Now A Disorder In The DSM-5"></a>Gambling Disorder Now A Disorder In The DSM-5</h1><p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a guide used by mental health professionals in the United States to diagnose mental disorders. The DSM-5, which was released in 2013, includes gambling disorder as a recognized disorder.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is now defined as a condition in which individuals exhibit problem gambling behavior. This behavior is characterized by repeated and persistent gambling behaviors that result in negative consequences for the individual, such as financial problems, relationship difficulties, and legal issues.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder can be quite serious, and can even lead to suicide in some cases. It is important to seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with gambling disorder. Treatment options include therapy and medication.</p>
