      IRS levies a hefty tax on gambling winnings!

        <h1 id="IRS-levies-a-hefty-tax-on-gambling-winnings"><a href="#IRS-levies-a-hefty-tax-on-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="IRS levies a hefty tax on gambling winnings!"></a>IRS levies a hefty tax on gambling winnings!</h1><p>The IRS imposes a hefty tax on gambling winnings, which is equivalent to the taxpayer’s marginal income tax rate. For example, if you are in the 25% tax bracket, then your gambling winnings will be taxed at 25%. Gambling losses can be used to offset taxable gambling winnings, but only up to the amount of gambling winnings.</p>
<p>You must report all of your gambling winnings on your federal income tax return. You do not need to report wins from slot machines or bingo. However, you must report all other types of winnings, including:</p>
<p>Poker tournaments</p>
<p>Lotteries</p>
<p>Races (horses, dogs, etc.)</p>
<p>Casino games (blackjack, craps, roulette, etc.)</p>
<p>Sports betting</p>
<p>If you receive a Form W-2G reporting your gambling winnings, then you must include the amount shown on the form in your gross income. If you receive a Form 1099-MISC reporting your gambling winnings, then you must also include the amount shown on the form in your gross income. You may have to pay self-employment tax on your gambling income.</p>
<h1 id="Taxman-comes-after-casino-profits"><a href="#Taxman-comes-after-casino-profits" class="headerlink" title="Taxman comes after casino profits!"></a>Taxman comes after casino profits!</h1><p>Casinos have been making record profits in recent years, thanks to the boom in spending by high rollers and tourists. But with more and more states legalizing gambling, and with casinos spreading into more populated areas, tax collectors are coming after their share of the winnings.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, for example, casinos paid nearly $100 million in taxes on their profits in 2016—a tenfold increase from the amount they paid in 2012. That’s because the state has been increasing its gambling tax rates, from 14% to 34%. And other states are following suit; New York is considering a new tax on casino profits that would bring in an estimated $434 million a year.</p>
<p>The big winners in all of this are the taxpayers, who are getting a piece of all that casino money. But the biggest losers may be the casinos themselves, which are having to pay more and more to stay in business.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-money-isn’t-as-tax-free-as-you-think"><a href="#Gambling-money-isn’t-as-tax-free-as-you-think" class="headerlink" title="Gambling money isn’t as tax-free as you think!"></a>Gambling money isn’t as tax-free as you think!</h1><p>Most people think that gambling money isn’t taxable, but that’s not always the case. Depending on how you gamble and where you gamble, you may have to pay taxes on your winnings.</p>
<p>There are two types of gambling - legal and illegal. Legal gambling is anything that is done within the law, such as playing the lottery or betting on a horse race. Illegal gambling is anything that is done outside of the law, such as playing blackjack in a casino or betting on sports games.</p>
<p>Gambling income is considered taxable income in most cases. This means that if you win money from gambling, you will have to report it on your tax return and may have to pay taxes on it. However, there are some exceptions. For example, if you gamble with money that you earned from your job, then the money you won from gambling is considered taxable income. However, if you won money from a contest or raffle, then that money is not considered taxable income.</p>
<p>For most people, gambling income is considered taxable income regardless of whether the winnings were received in one lump sum or over time. There are a few exceptions to this rule, including certain kinds of lotteries and some types of prizes awarded by casinos.</p>
<p>If you have to pay taxes on your gambling income, there are a few ways to do so. You can either report your winnings as regular income on your tax return, or you can claim them as losses. If you choose to report your winnings as regular income, then you will have to pay taxes on them at your normal tax rate. However, if you choose to claim your winnings as losses, then you can deduct them from your other taxable income. This will lower your overall tax bill for the year.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time and potentially make some extra money, but it’s important to remember that not all gambling activities are tax-free. Make sure you understand how gambling income is taxed in your area so that you can properly report any winnings and avoid any penalties from the IRS.</p>
<h1 id="State-taxes-on-gambling-could-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past"><a href="#State-taxes-on-gambling-could-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past" class="headerlink" title="State taxes on gambling could soon be a thing of the past!"></a>State taxes on gambling could soon be a thing of the past!</h1><p>Ohio lawmakers have proposed a bill that would repeal the state’s taxes on gambling winnings. The proposed bill, House Bill 529, was introduced by Republican State Representatives Jim Buchy and Gary Scherer.</p>
<p>The bill would exempt gambling income from state income tax, including winnings from casino games, lotteries, and other gambling activities. Buchy said that the goal of the bill is to make Ohio more competitive with surrounding states that do not have a state income tax.</p>
<p>“House Bill 529 is about creating a level playing field for Ohio’s gaming industry by repealing the state’s 6.75 percent income tax on gambling winnings,” Buchy said in a statement. “This will help make Ohio more competitive with our neighboring states and encourage more gamers to spend their money in our casinos.”</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it could generate millions of dollars in new revenue for the state government. Opponents argue that the state could lose millions of dollars in revenue from taxes on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>The proposed bill is currently pending before the House Finance Committee. If it is approved by the committee, it will be sent to the full House for a vote.</p>
<h1 id="Are-you-paying-your-fair-share-of-taxes-on-your-gambling-winnings"><a href="#Are-you-paying-your-fair-share-of-taxes-on-your-gambling-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Are you paying your fair share of taxes on your gambling winnings?"></a>Are you paying your fair share of taxes on your gambling winnings?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, it’s important to be aware of the tax laws that could affect your winnings. Are you required to report your gambling winnings on your tax return? How much tax do you have to pay on gambling income?</p>
<p>Gambling income is any income you receive from gambling activities, including casino games, lotteries, and wagers. Gaming establishments must report your winnings to the IRS, so you’re likely to receive a Form W-2G (or similar form) reporting the amount of your winnings.</p>
<p>In most cases, you must report all of your gambling winnings as taxable income on your tax return. The amount of tax you owe will depend on your overall taxable income and other factors. Gambling losses can be deducted as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A, but they can only be claimed up to the amount of your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>If you’re a professional gambler, you may be able to claim your gambling losses as a business expense. However, there are special rules and limits that apply in this case.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep good records of your gambling activities, including receipts and other documentation of wins and losses. This information can help support any deductions you claim on your tax return.</p>
