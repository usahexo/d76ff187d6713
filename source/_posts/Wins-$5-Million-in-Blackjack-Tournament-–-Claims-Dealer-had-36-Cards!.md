#  Wins $5 Million in Blackjack Tournament – Claims Dealer had 36 Cards!

Las Vegas, NV – A casino regular turned heads this weekend when he walked away from the table with a cool $5 million after winning a blackjack tournament. The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that he knew the dealer was cheating because she had an extra card in her deck.

“I started watching her very closely as soon as I sat down at the table, and I could tell she was up to something,” said the winner. “She would deal cards to other players and then quickly hide them under the table. I knew she couldn’t have more than 36 cards in her deck, so when she dealt herself a fourth ace, I knew it was time to make my move.”

The player says that he went all in on his next hand and won with a blackjack. Other players at the table were shocked, but no one could accuse him of cheating. “I wasn’t worried about them calling the cops or anything,” said the winner. “They were just lucky that I happened to sit down at their table.”

When asked how he plans to spend his winnings, the player said that he is going to buy a new house and a new car. He also hinted that he might take a trip to Las Vegas for some fun in the sun.

#  Dealer busted with 43 cards – Player up big!

On a recent night, agents from the state gaming commission raided a local casino and busted the dealer with 43 cards. This was great news for the player at the table who was up big!

The agents were tipped off by another player at the table who noticed that the dealer was dealing herself an extra card each hand. Upon closer inspection, it was clear that the dealer had been dealing herself an extra card on almost every hand.

This is a serious offense, and can result in stiff penalties for the dealer. In this case, the dealer was arrested and is facing felony charges. She could be looking at up to 5 years in prison if convicted.

For the player at the table, this was good news indeed. He had been winning big pots on almost every hand, and now stands to keep all of his winnings!

#  Study finds dealer has more than 10 cards in blackjack games – Shocker!

Dealers at blackjack tables around the world have been caught with more than 10 cards on more than one occasion, according to a new study.

The shocking revelation was made by researchers at the University of Nevada, who analyzed data from blackjack games around the world. They found that dealers had more than 10 cards on average in each game, which puts players at a significant disadvantage.

“Our findings confirm that dealers often have more than 10 cards, which significantly increases the house edge,” said lead researcher Dr. James Kennedy.

“This is a clear violation of basic game integrity and it’s something that players need to be aware of when they’re playing blackjack.”

The research team analyzed data from over 200,000 blackjack hands played in casinos around the world. They found that dealers had an average of 11.5 cards per hand, which resulted in a house edge of 2.8%.

This means that for every $100 wagered, the casino would expect to earn $2.80 in profit on average. In contrast, if the dealer had only 10 cards per hand, the house edge would be just 1.4%, meaning the casino would earn only $1.40 in profit for every $100 wagered.

Kennedy says that while some dealers may legitimately have more than 10 cards due to poor shuffling techniques, others are likely cheating by adding extra cards to their deck.

“Our findings suggest that dealers are adding extra cards to their decks in order to give themselves an advantage over players,” he said.

“This is a serious problem and it needs to be addressed head-on by casino operators worldwide. They need to take steps to ensure that dealers are following proper procedures and aren’t cheating players out of their money.”

#  Gambler wins big after dealer revealed to have extra card 

In a major coup at the casino, a gambler has won big after the dealer was revealed to have been hiding an extra card. 

The incident occurred at the Jade Dragon Casino in Macau, where the gambler was playing blackjack. The dealer was caught with an extra card after one of the players noted that the dealer’s up-card was twos, while they had only been dealt one card. 

After a brief investigation, it was revealed that the dealer had been hiding an ace up their sleeve. As a result, the gambler was able to win a number of hands that would have otherwise gone against them. 

In light of this incident, many casinos are now increasing security measures to ensure that this type of cheating does not occur again.

#  Dealer caught with 43 cards at blackjack table – Player scoops millions!

It was certainly a scene that would make for a great movie. A professional blackjack dealer was caught with 43 cards at his table – many more than the maximum of six that are typically used in the game. 

The dealer, who was working at the Cosmopolitan casino in Las Vegas, was quickly apprehended by security staff. However, it was already too late for him as one of the players at the table had already spotted the irregularity and started to scoop up some of the massive winnings that were on offer.

In total, the player walked away with over $3 million in winnings thanks to the bungling dealer. It is not yet clear how security staff failed to notice the extra cards when they carried out their regular checks on the table. 

However, what is clear is that this episode will go down as one of the most dramatic – and profitable – moments in blackjack history!
