#  What is the objective of Scarab Temple Hold and Win?

The Scarab Temple Hold and Win is an ARG (alternate reality game) that was launched on 8/8/2018. The game's objective is to work together as a team to hold off waves of enemies in the Scarab Temple, and eventually win by defeating the boss.

# What are the rewards for completing the game?

There are several rewards for completing the game. The first is gaining access to the secret room, which contains various items such as weapons and armor. The second is a trophy that can be displayed on your profile. Finally, there are exclusive items that can only be obtained by completing the game.

#  How do you play Scarab Temple Hold and Win?

Scarab Temple Hold is the first in a series of two-player games that focus on area control and card drafting. In this game, players are Egyptian gods vying for control of the scarce resources available in the temple. The game board is triangular and has 11 spaces, with nine being for cards and two for the player’s pieces. The goal is to be the first to place all four pieces onto the board, or to have the most pieces on the board at the end of the game.

The game is played over a series of rounds. In each round, players will take turns drafting one card from the nine on offer and then playing it onto one of their three zones: left, right, or center. After both players have placed all their cards for the round, scoring takes place. Points are scored for majorities in each zone, as well as for majorities in each of two color sets: blue and red. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

Now that we know how to play, let’s take a look at some tips on how to win Scarab Temple Hold!

1) Think ahead and plan your moves accordingly.

It can be tempting to just play whatever card you happen to draw each turn, but taking a bit of time to plan your moves can pay off big dividends later in the game. You want to try and build up majorities in certain zones so that you can score bonus points at the end of each round. Additionally, it’s important to keep track of what cards your opponent has played – this will allow you to predict their moves and hopefully block them from scoring too many points.

2) Utilize your special abilities wisely.

Each god in Scarab Temple Hold has a unique special ability that can help you gain an advantage over your opponent. Make sure you use these abilities whenever possible – they can be the difference between winning and losing!

3) Don’t be afraid to block your opponent’s moves.

In any area control game, blocking your opponent’s moves is a key strategy for victory. If you see that your opponent is about to make a move that would give them a majority in one of your zones, do whatever you can to stop them! You may not always be able to thwart their plans, but even occasional prevention can be enough to swing the game in your favor.
