#  What are the bonus features? 

A bonus feature, in the context of movies or video games, is a special A bonus feature, in the context of movies or video games, is a special
additional scene or footage that is available on home media releases but not
shown in theaters. Bonus features may be included on Blu-ray Discs, DVDs,
digital downloads, or other forms of home media.

Bonus features are often included as an incentive for people to purchase a home media release instead of obtaining the content by other means. For example, early DVD releases of the Star Wars films included documentaries about the making of the movies. Similarly, many Blu-ray Discs include bonus features that are not available on streaming services such as Netflix.

Movie studios often produce different versions of a movie for different markets. The theatrical release might be edited for length and language while the home media release might include additional scenes or footage not shown in theaters. For example, the British home media release of Deadpool includes an alternate opening scene that was not shown in theaters. 

Some bonus features are created specifically for home media releases. For example, Disney has produced a number of "behind the scenes" shorts for its animated movies that are only available on home media releases. These shorts typically include interviews with the directors and animators as well as footage from the production process. 

While most bonus features are simply added onto a home media release without any fanfare, some studios have begun promoting them more heavily in recent years. For example, 20th Century Fox released a promotional video for its upcoming Blu-ray release of Logan that highlights its many bonus features.
