#  ASVEL is considering doubling down on blackjack 
The Lyon, France-based professional basketball team ASVEL is considering doubling down on blackjack by creating a dedicated blackjack team.

The new ASVEL Blackjack Team would compete in international tournaments and, if successful, could bring more attention to the already popular sport of blackjack.

ASVEL President Nicolas Leasketball said that the team is considering the move as a way to further promote the club and its brand. "This would be an additional tool to promote our club and more generally, our region," he said.

The proposal for a blackjack team was first raised by ASVEL Director General Jerome Fenoglio, who is also President of the French Blackjack Federation. Fenoglio said that the new team would give players a chance to "demonstrate their skills on an international stage."

So far, there has been no decision on whether or not to create the new team, but it's clear that there is some interest in doing so. If ASVEL does decide to go ahead with the idea, it could end up being one of the top teams in the world when it comes to blackjack.

#  ASVEL to boost blackjack strength with doubledowns 

In a bid to bolster its blackjack strength, French basketball club ASVEL signed American forward Maurice Douglass on Wednesday.

The 36-year-old spent last season in Turkey with Banvit and averaged 5.8 points and 6.6 rebounds in 24 minutes per game.

Douglass, who has previous stints in the NBA with Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers, is set to provide some much needed muscle inside for ASVEL, who were knocked out of the playoffs by Strasbourg last month.

"Maurice is an experienced player who will bring a lot to our team," said ASVEL coach Philippe Hervé. "He's a good defender and rebounder and will be important to us both offensively and defensively."

It's not yet clear how big a role Douglass will have with ASVEL next season but his signing is certainly a statement of intent as they look to improve on last year's showing.

#  When is the best time to Double Down in Blackjack? 

There's no simple answer to this question, as the optimal decision depends on a variety of factors including the cards you are dealt and the casino's rules. However, there are some general principles that can help guide your decision making.

The first thing to keep in mind is that doubling down is generally most advantageous when you have a hand that is worth around 10 points. For this reason, it's usually a good idea to double down when you are dealt Ace/10 or Ace/9. However, if the dealer is showing a low card (6 or less), it may be better to wait for a better opportunity to double down.

Another thing to consider is the casino's rules. Some casinos allow players to double down on any two cards, while others require players to have at least 11 points before they can double down. If the casino has stricter rules, it may be wise to hold off on doubling down until you get a stronger hand.

In the end, there is no one "correct" answer to the question of when to double down in blackjack. It's important to weigh all of the factors involved and make the decision that gives you the best chance of winning. With a little bit of practice, you'll be able to make sound decisions every time and increase your chances of walking away with some extra cash!

#  ASVEL doubles down on blackjack with new strategy 

Casinos have long been a staple of the gambling industry, and blackjack has always been one of the most popular games. In recent years, online casinos have become increasingly popular, and ASVEL is hoping to capitalize on this trend with a new blackjack strategy.

ASVEL's new strategy is centered around doubling down on blackjack. This involves aggressively increasing your bet after the first two cards are dealt in an effort to increase your chances of winning. While doubling down can be a risky move, ASVEL believes that it can be very profitable if done correctly.

There are several factors to consider when deciding whether or not to double down. First, you need to make sure that you have enough money to cover your potential losses. Second,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) you need to make sure that the odds are in your favor. Finally, you need to be comfortable with the amount of risk you are taking.

If you decide to double down, it's important to remember that you are betting twice as much as you originally bet. This means that you can win or lose twice as much money. It's also important to keep in mind that if you lose, you will have to forfeit both your original bet and your doubled bet.

ASVEL's new strategy is still in development, so it's too early to say whether or not it will be successful. However, doubling down on blackjack can be a very effective way to win money at the casino, provided you make smart decisions and avoid excessive risk-taking.

#  ASVEL goes all in on blackjack, doubles down for success

In an effort to further its success on the basketball court, ASVEL has decided to place a greater emphasis on blackjack. The club has doubled down on the game in an effort to improve its fortunes.

Blackjack is seen as a game of skill and precision, which is why ASVEL feels it can be of great use to the team. Coach David Bonnetti is of the belief that if his players can maintain a solid level of play at blackjack, it will help them when they take to the court.

"The cards are like the basketballs," Bonnetti said. "There's always a risk, but with good play, we can minimize that risk and make some money too."

The team has already seen some success with its new strategy, winning two out of its first three matches inblackjack. This has helped ASVEL climb up the league table, and they now sit in second place behind Limoges CSP.

While the move may seem unorthodox, it could prove to be very successful for ASVEL. Blackjack is a challenging game that requires focus and concentration, which could translate well to on-court success.
