#  Dragon 4 Casino Guide: How to Win Thor Hammer Time Game 

Dragon 4 casino, a popular online casino destination, offers a variety of exciting and rewarding games. One of these games is Thor Hammer Time, which can be quite lucrative if played correctly. 

The premise of the game is to help Thor smash as many enemies as possible with his hammer in order to win rewards. Players can choose between two different modes: adventure or survival. In adventure mode, players progress through levels and earn rewards for each one they complete. In survival mode, players attempt to last as long as possible while racking up rewards. 

For the best chance of winning in Thor Hammer Time, it’s important to understand how the game works. The hammer has three different swings: a fast swing, a medium swing, and a slow swing. The speed of the swinging hammer determines how much damage it does to enemies. The faster the swing, the more damage it does. 

In addition, hammers also have a heat meter. When the meter is full, the player can use an uppercut to do extra damage to enemies. There are also power-ups scattered throughout the levels that can help players defeat enemies more easily. 

Knowing all this, it’s important to plan your attacks carefully in order to make the most of every swing and every opportunity for bonus damage. Try to focus on clearing waves of enemies as quickly as possible so that you can move on to the next wave and get those valuable rewards. 

With a little practice, you too can be smashing enemies and winning big in Thor Hammer Time at Dragon 4 casino!
