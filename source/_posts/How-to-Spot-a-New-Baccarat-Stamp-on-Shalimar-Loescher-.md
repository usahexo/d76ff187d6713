#  How to Spot a New Baccarat Stamp on Shalimar Loescher 

The musty smell of an old book is always a delight. Turning the yellowed pages, you notice a small stamp in the corner. This Baccarat stamp could be worth quite a bit of money!

Baccarat is a high-end French manufacturer of luxury goods that was founded in 1764. The company produces items such as glassware, tabletop items, and crystal. Collectors seek out Baccarat for its beauty and durability.

Certain pieces by Baccarat are worth more than others. For example, a stamp from the Belle Ã‰poque era (1890-1914) can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars at auction. So how do you know if you have a valuable piece?

The easiest way to spot a genuine Baccarat stamp is to look for the words "Baccarat France" or "Baccarat crystal". If the word "France" is missing, it's likely not an authentic stamp. There are also some subtle differences between genuine and fake stamps. Genuine stamps typically have sharper edges and cleaner lines than counterfeits.

If you're not sure whether your piece is authentic or not, there are several experts who can help you determine its value. The most well-known expert on Baccarat stamps is Loescher Shalimar, author of several books on the subject. Shalimar has been collecting stamps since he was a child and knows more about Baccarat stamps than anyone else in the world.

If you have a Baccarat stamp that you believe may be worth something, I suggest consulting with Shalimar or another expert to have it appraised. Who knows, you may be holding on to a rare piece worth thousands of dollars!
