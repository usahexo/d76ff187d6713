# What is the game about?

Animal Crossing is a life simulation game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube console in 2002. Players take control of a human character who moves into a new town, meets other animal characters, and participates in activities such as fishing, bug catching, fossil hunting, and fruit picking. The player can also visit other players' towns via local wireless or over the Internet.

Animal Crossing introduced several features that would later become staples of the series, including seasonal events based on real-world holidays and the ability to obtain items by trading with other players. The game was critically acclaimed, selling over 11 million copies worldwide. It was ported to the Wii in 2009 and the Nintendo 3DS in 2012.

# How do you play?

The objective of Animal Crossing is to live a happy life in a virtual world filled with anthropomorphic animals. Players can interact with their animal neighbors by performing various tasks for them, playing games, exchanging favors, and occasionally arguing. They can also decorate their home with furniture and assorted objects that they either craft themselves or receive as presents from others.

In addition to providing cosmetic changes, furniture can also change a player's environment in a functional way; for example, placing a desk in front of a window will allow the player to sit at the desk and perform work tasks such as writing letters or using the computer. Players are also able to change their hairstyle and clothes to match their current mood or style.

Many elements of Animal Crossing are dictated by real-world time; for example, trees will bloom and fruits will grow at specific times of year. In addition, special themed events may occur on specific days or weeks. For instance, Easter eggs may be found hidden around town during Easter week or fireworks may be set off on Independence Day.
