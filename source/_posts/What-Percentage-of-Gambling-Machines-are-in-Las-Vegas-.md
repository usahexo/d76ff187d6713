#  What Percentage of Gambling Machines are in Las Vegas? 
The gambling capital of the world is Las Vegas. While there are many different types of gambling available in Sin City, slot machines are by far the most popular. The question that often comes up is what percentage of the machines are in Las Vegas?

The answer to this question is difficult to determine. However, there are a few estimates that can give us a general idea. The first estimate comes from the Nevada Gaming Control Board. In their 2016 annual report, they stated that there were over 269,000 slot machines in operation in Nevada casinos. This works out to be about 83% of all gambling devices in the state. 

It should be noted that not all of these machines are in Las Vegas. In fact, most of them are located on the Las Vegas Strip. This is where the majority of casino resorts are located. As a result, it is safe to assume that at least 80% of all slot machines in Nevada are in Las Vegas. 

Another estimate can be found in a study by Casino City Research Ltd.. They surveyed 447 casinos across the United States and found that 91% of them had at least one slot machine. This would work out to be about 236,000 machines nationally. If we assume that the same percentage holds true for Nevada, then there would be around 205,000 machines in Las Vegas. 

While these numbers aren’t exact, they provide a good estimate as to how many slot machines are in Las Vegas. And it’s clear that there are a lot!
