#  What is the history of the marker casino Toronto Blue Jays?

The Toronto Blue Jays are a Canadian professional baseball team based in Toronto, Ontario. The Blue Jays compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. From 1977 to 2004, the team played its home games at the SkyDome, since renamed Rogers Centre. The "Blue Jays" name originates from the bird of the same name, and blue is also the traditional colour of two of Toronto's other professional sports teams: the Maple Leafs (ice hockey) and the Argonauts (football).

The team was founded in 1977, as one of two teams competing for Canada's first major league baseball franchise. The Blue Jays were created as part of MLB's expansion into Canada, along with the Montreal Expos. In 1985, the Blue Jays became the first team outside the United States to win a World Series championship. They won again in 1992 and 1993, becoming only the second team (after the Oakland Athletics) to repeat as World Series champions. After 1993, they failed to qualify for post-season play until 2015.

Next year in 2017 marked their 40th season in Toronto and 20th season at Rogers Centre. In late-July Rogers Communications announced that they had reached an agreement to purchase controlling interest in MLSE, which owns and operates both of Toronto's major spectator sports franchises, from Bell Canada and Larry Tanenbaum who will retain minority ownership interests in both franchises. Rogers plans to boost annual revenue from Leafs, Raptors and Blue Jays ticket sales by 50%, or $100 million per year by 2021. 

In March 2018 Mark Shapiro was named president and CEO of Rogers Communications' Sportsnet and NHL properties including his former role as president of MLB Productions LLC.  His father worked for Allen Becker who owned "Becker Shoes" on Yonge St., north of Dundas St., circa 1967 when Shapiro was born; he would deliver shoes to local stores including Sam Pollock's "Sportsworld". He remembers going into Sportsworld as a kid with his dad: "It was my first foray into sport...I was like six years old." 

Now lets jump into some questions that I'm sure many people are wondering about when it comes to this great team!

? What was their jersey logo before 1993?

Prior to 1993, their logo was simply an italicized blue letter "T". However, beginning in 1993, their logo consisted of a three-dimensional maple leaf with a blue jay perched on top. This logo underwent minor revisions between 1997 and 2007 but has remained largely unchanged since then.

? Who were some notable players on the team during their early years?

Some notable players during the Blue Jays' early years include George Bell (1987 AL MVP), Dave Stieb (3-time All-Star), Roberto Alomar (5-time All-Star), Joe Carter (1993 World Series MVP), José Canseco (1988 AL MVP). In addition, Cito Gaston served as manager for both World Series championship teams (1992 & 1993).

? How did they fare in their very first playoffs?

In their first playoff appearance in 1984, they were swept by the Detroit Tigers in three games. However, they would eventually make it to postseason play 19 times between 1984 and 2015.
