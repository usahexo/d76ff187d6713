#  Aladdin oil lamp goes up for auction - could fetch millions!

The famous Aladdin oil lamp is set to go up for auction on Wednesday and is expected to fetch millions of dollars.

The lamp was originally discovered by a group of miners in Persia in the early 1900s and has been in the possession of one family since then.

The lamp is made of bronze and gold and is inscribed with intricate designs. It is also believed to have magical properties, as legend has it that the lamp can make wishes come true.

The auction house, Sotheby's, expects the lamp to sell for anywhere between $2 and $6 million. So far, there has been no confirmed buyer but there is sure to be plenty of interest from collectors around the world.

An oil lamp that was once owned by the late casino magnate Steve Wynn has been put up for auction. The Aladdin lamp is said to be worth $1 million.

Wynn, who died earlier this year, is known for his lavish lifestyle and passion for collecting antiques. His estate sale has yielded some interesting finds, including the Aladdin lamp.

The lamp was last seen in public in 2009, when it was displayed at an auction of Wynn's collection. At the time, it was estimated to be worth $2 million.

The current owner of the lamp is a private collector who acquired it from Wynn's estate. He is now putting it up for auction with a starting bid of $1 million.

The Aladdin lamp has a colorful history dating back to the early 1800s. It is said to have been discovered by a French soldier in Syria who brought it back to Europe. From there, it made its way to the United States, where it was acquired by Wynn.

The lamp is a rare example of early Syrian pottery and is highly sought after by collectors. It is expected to generate a great deal of interest when it goes up for auction later this month.
